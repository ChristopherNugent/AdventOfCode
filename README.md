# TL;DR

I'm doing Advent of Code for fun.

As a major note to anyone who reads this, I'm just going to cram all the support classes for a given solution as a private class, at least as of time of writing when it looks like each day's codebase will be less than a few dozen lines and I want to avoid namespace pollution. I do NOT advocate that approach for any actual project.
